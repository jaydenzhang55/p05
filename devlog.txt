*Python Style Guide (PEP 8):*
 - Function and variable naming conventions (snake_case) — consistency across scraping, PDF parsing, and AI response logic.
 - Import grouping and ordering — improved clarity at the top of each file (standard libraries, packages like requests or PyMuPDF).
 - Line length limited to 79-88 characters — improved editor readability and diff tools.
 - Consistent 4-space indentation — no mixed tabs/spaces.
 - Descriptive docstrings and inline comments — explain complex logic, especially in PDF scraping and AI answering.
 - Whitespace around operators — visual clarity in calculations and conditionals.
 - Use of type hints — added to key functions.
 - Modular structure — separate files for routes, utils, parsing, and AI logic followed the “one purpose per file” guideline.

Most Useful/Appreciated by Developers:
 - Emphasis on readability over cleverness.
 - Clear function documentation — allowed developers to understand behavior and usage quickly.

Reference Example:
```def pdfExtractor(pdf_path: str) -> str:```
 - Proper naming, type hints, and a "single-responsibility" layout.

*JavaScript Style Guide*

 - Use of const and let instead of var — avoided bugs and shows variable scope.
 - Arrow function syntax is cleaner for async functions and callbacks.
 - Consistent semicolon usage — prevented automatic semicolon insertion (ASI) issues.
 - 2-space indentation — used for JS files.
 - Avoidance of deeply nested callbacks — Promises and async/await => readability + reduced indentation hell.
 - Separation of concerns — organized event listeners, DOM queries, and fetch logic into scripts.
 - CamelCase naming — followed standard for variables and functions.
 - Single quotes for strings — via linter/prettier for consistency.

Most Useful/Appreciated by Developers:
 - Style reduced differences and merge conflicts.
 - Whitespace and indentation rules are used in formatting.
 - Troubleshooting (e.g., for upload failures) is much easier through modular JS files.

Example:
```const handleUpload = async (event) => {}```
Clear use of const, arrow function, and asynchronous handling in a concise, modern format.
